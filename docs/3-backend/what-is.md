# Web Development

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](/img/web-dev.png)](/img/web-dev.png)

**Web Development** is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications that are accessible via the internet or an intranet.

## Website and Web Application
Both terms are interchangeable, since a web application is also a website. Hence, a website is just a simpler web application (web app), and a web application is a more complex website.
A more concrete definition can be made based on how users interact with the website.
Interaction with visitors on a website is limited to browsing and consuming content, with minimal interactivity beyond navigation and form submissions (contact forms, newsletter subscription). Examples of websites: University websites or government websites.

Interaction with users in web applications is more extensive, involving form submissions, real-time updates, data retrieval and storage, user authentication, and personalized experiences. Examples of web apps: Social media web apps such as Facebook and Twitter, Google Drive, Shopee, and YouTube.
Most of the time, web apps also have an Android or an IOS mobile app.

## Different Kinds of Web Developers
There are different types of professionals involve in web development:

    * **Front-End Developers**: They work on the client-side of web development, using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.
    * **Back-End Developers**: They handle the server-side of web development, managing databases, server logic, and application integration using languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, or JavaScript (Node.js) and frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, or Express.js.
    * **DevOps Engineers**: They focus on automating deployment, scaling, and monitoring of web applications, ensuring their reliability, security, and performance.
    * **Full-Stack Developers**: They have skills in both front-end and back-end development and DevOps, enabling them to work on all aspects of a web application.

## Backend Development
Backend development involves creating and managing the server-side logic, databases, and application architecture that enable the functionality and data processing of a website or application.

## Types of Backend Development
Backend development encompasses various types, each tailored to specific requirements and preferences. Some prominent types of backend development include:

1. Web Development - What we will be focusing on.
1. Database Development
1. API Development
1. Microservices Development
1. Serverless Development
1. Real-time Development
1. Content Management Systems (CMS) Development

These are just a few examples of the diverse landscape of backend development, each with its own set of technologies, methodologies, and best practices tailored to specific application requirements and use cases.

## Backend Programming Languages 

These are the commonly used languages in web development:

1. JavaScript (Node.js)
1. Python
1. Java
1. Ruby
1. PHP
1. C# (ASP.NET)
1. Go (Golang)
1. Scala (with Play Framework)

These are just a few examples of the many backend programming languages available to developers, each with its own set of features, strengths, and communities. The choice of language often depends on factors such as project requirements, developer expertise, performance considerations, and ecosystem support.
