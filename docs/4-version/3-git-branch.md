# Git Branch

Git branching is a powerful feature of the version control system Git that allows developers to create separate lines of development, diverging from the main codebase.

1. `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.

1. `git branch [branch_name]`: Creates a new branch with the specified name.

1. `git checkout [branch_name]`: Switches to the specified branch.

1. `git checkout -b [branch_name]`: Creates a new branch and switches to it in one step.

1. `git merge [branch_name]`: Merges changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

## Git Branch

```bash
